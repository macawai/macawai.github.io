abstract: |
  An evolving weighted neuro-neo-fuzzy-ANARX model and its learning procedures
  are introduced in the article. This system is basically used for time series
  forecasting. This system may be considered as a pool of elements that process
  data in a parallel manner. The proposed evolving system may provide online
  processing data streams.
