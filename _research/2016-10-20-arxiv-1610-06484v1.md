abstract: |
  Neo-fuzzy elements are used as nodes for an evolving cascade system. The
  proposed system can tune both its parameters and architecture in an online
  mode. It can be used for solving a wide range of Data Mining tasks (namely time
  series forecasting). The evolving cascade system with neo-fuzzy nodes can
  process rather large data sets with high speed and effectiveness.
