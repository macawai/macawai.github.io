abstract: |
  A new architecture and learning algorithms for the multidimensional hybrid
  cascade neural network with neuron pool optimization in each cascade are
  proposed in this paper. The proposed system differs from the well-known cascade
  systems in its capability to process multidimensional time series in an online
  mode, which makes it possible to process non-stationary stochastic and chaotic
  signals with the required accuracy. Compared to conventional analogs, the
  proposed system provides computational simplicity and possesses both tracking
  and filtering capabilities.
