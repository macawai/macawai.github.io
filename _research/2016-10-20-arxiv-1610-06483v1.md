abstract: |
  A modification of the neo-fuzzy neuron is proposed (an extended neo-fuzzy
  neuron (ENFN)) that is characterized by improved approximating properties. An
  adaptive learning algorithm is proposed that has both tracking and smoothing
  properties. An ENFN distinctive feature is its computational simplicity
  compared to other artificial neural networks and neuro-fuzzy systems.
