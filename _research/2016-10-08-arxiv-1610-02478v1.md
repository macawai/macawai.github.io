## Abstract
>   We examine two recent artificial intelligence (AI) based deep learning
> algorithms for visual blending in convolutional neural networks (Mordvintsev et
> al. 2015, Gatys et al. 2015). To investigate the potential value of these
> algorithms as tools for computational creativity research, we explain and
> schematize the essential aspects of the algorithms' operation and give visual
> examples of their output. We discuss the relationship of the two algorithms to
> human cognitive science theories of creativity such as conceptual blending
> theory and honing theory, and characterize the algorithms with respect to
> generation of novelty and aesthetic quality.
