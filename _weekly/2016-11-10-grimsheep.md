  intro: |
    Some applications of AI are simply a little more fun than others, and this week we've rounded up some particularly good features in video games, creative rhyming and automated zero-day attack mitigations. Unrelated (or are they?)... Anyway, take a look at some of the great learning resources in our sidebar closing and go and watch that fantastic original-internet meme about all your bases, because you know, [DeepMind will shortly set us up the bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fvTxv46ano) (because, you know, Starcraft). Happy Thursday.
