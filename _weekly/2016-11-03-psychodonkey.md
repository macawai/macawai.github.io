  intro: |
    Ever heard of the uncanny valley? It's a Computer Graphics term referring to photo-realist work that somehow just doesn't quite "feel" right. Close, but.. plastic.. and can't really explain why. It's a conceptual trick-step to apply this to AI, but it is interesting that several of our items this week relate in some or other way to the "space" between the promises, intentions and applications of AI work at the moment. From "hallucinated details", "blanket facial surveillance" and the vaguely disappointing performance of "AI assistants" it's ironic that some of this discontent would simply go away if we stopped caring about things like privacy or fidelity (of reality, or social contracts in general). Anyway, perhaps seeing this connection is a bit like those old "3D magic images", where you had to focus just right and suddenly \*pop\*, ice cream cone. Look closely, there's an ice-cream cone in here too.

    And as a fun closing note, if our posts over the past couple weeks regarding blanket surveillance, automatic facial detection and descrambling pixelated faces have you a little unnerved, take heart (and follow the work [EPIC](https://epic.org/privacy/facerecognition/) does). Some researchers from Carnegie Mellon have got you covered with ["Real and Stealthy Attacks on State-of-the-Art Face Recognition"](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sbhagava/papers/face-rec-ccs16.pdf) (redux: clever reverse mapping peturbations applied to printed glasses frames - you are now Russell Crowe). You could also hook up some wild hair and makeup options from [CVDazzle](https://cvdazzle.com/) or if you're on the run from drones go the full fashion route with [Stealth Wear](https://ahprojects.com/projects/stealth-wear/). You're welcome.
