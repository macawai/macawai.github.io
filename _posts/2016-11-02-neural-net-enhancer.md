As seen on TV: "Bring up that security footage, the 320x320 pixelated matchbox, yeah that one, hmm what's that in the corner, zoom, zoom, rotate, zoom, enhance. ENHANCE! OMG WE GOT IT" etc. Yeah. 'Enhance'. Making anyone who knows anything roll their eyes since the eighties (anyone got any earlier references? Let us know!!). But here we have a legitimate contender for making that scenario less eye-roll-y: this neat setup basically hallucinates image details (remember [Deep Dream](https://research.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html)) based on training data. The closer the domain match (training data to image being enhanced), the better the results. Of course, it's basically just an (automated) artist's "impression", so lets hope our justice system never takes these results too seriously.
