## Abstract
>   Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) perform wastewater treatment and electricity
> production through the conversion of organic matter using microorganisms. For
> practical applications, it has been suggested that greater efficiency can be
> achieved by arranging multiple MFC units into physical stacks in a cascade with
> feedstock flowing sequentially between units. In this paper, we investigate the
> use of computational intelligence to physically explore and optimise
> (potentially) heterogeneous MFC designs in a cascade, i.e. without simulation.
> Conductive structures are 3-D printed and inserted into the anodic chamber of
> each MFC unit, augmenting a carbon fibre veil anode and affecting the
> hydrodynamics, including the feedstock volume and hydraulic retention time, as
> well as providing unique habitats for microbial colonisation. We show that it
> is possible to use design mining to identify new conductive inserts that
> increase both the cascade power output and power density.
