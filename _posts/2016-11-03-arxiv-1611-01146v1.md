  We design a non-convex second-order optimization algorithm that is guaranteed
  to return an approximate local minimum in time which is linear in the input
  representation. The previously fastest methods run in time proportional to
  matrix inversion or worse.
  The time complexity of our algorithm to find a local minimum is even faster
  than that of gradient descent to find a critical point (which can be a saddle
  point). Our algorithm applies to a very general class of optimization problems
  including training a neural network and many other non-convex objectives
  arising in machine learning.
