  In this paper, we propose a method of human activity recognition with high
  throughput from raw accelerometer data applying a deep recurrent neural network
  (DRNN), and investigate various architectures and its combination to find the
  best parameter values. The "high throughput" refers to short time at a time of
  recognition. We investigated various parameters and architectures of the DRNN
  by using the training dataset of 432 trials with 6 activity classes from 7
  people. The maximum recognition rate was 95.42% and 83.43% against the test
  data of 108 segmented trials each of which has single activity class and 18
  multiple sequential trials, respectively. Here, the maximum recognition rates
  by traditional methods were 71.65% and 54.97% for each. In addition, the
  efficiency of the found parameters was evaluated by using additional dataset.
  Further, as for throughput of the recognition per unit time, the constructed
  DRNN was requiring only 1.347 [ms], while the best traditional method required
  11.031 [ms] which includes 11.027 [ms] for feature calculation. These
  advantages are caused by the compact and small architecture of the constructed
  real time oriented DRNN.
