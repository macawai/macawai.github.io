abstract: |
  Recent research in the deep learning field has produced a plethora of new
  architectures. At the same time, a growing number of groups are applying deep
  learning to new applications. Some of these groups are likely to be composed of
  inexperienced deep learning practitioners who are baffled by the dizzying array
  of architecture choices and therefore opt to use an older architecture (i.e.,
  Alexnet). Here we attempt to bridge this gap by mining the collective knowledge
  contained in recent deep learning research to discover underlying principles
  for designing neural network architectures. In addition, we describe several
  architectural innovations, including Fractal of FractalNet network, Stagewise
  Boosting Networks, and Taylor Series Networks (our Caffe code and prototxt
  files will be made publicly available). We hope others are inspired to build on
  our preliminary work.
