  Controlling the flow and routing of data is a fundamental problem in many
  distributed networks, including transportation systems, integrated circuits,
  and the Internet. In the brain, synaptic plasticity rules have been discovered
  that regulate network activity in response to environmental inputs, which
  enable circuits to be stable yet flexible. Here, we develop a new
  neuro-inspired model for network flow control that only depends on modifying
  edge weights in an activity-dependent manner. We show how two fundamental
  plasticity rules (long-term potentiation and long-term depression) can be cast
  as a distributed gradient descent algorithm for regulating traffic flow in
  engineered networks. We then characterize, both via simulation and
  analytically, how different forms of edge-weight update rules affect network
  routing efficiency and robustness. We find a close correspondence between
  certain classes of synaptic weight update rules derived experimentally in the
  brain and rules commonly used in engineering, suggesting common principles to
  both.
