The US appears to be lagging China in AI research, at least by journal articles that mention “deep learning” or “deep neural network”. Estimates that current levels of R&D spending on AI are one-half to one-quarter of the levels that would be best for economic growth. And, like this article says, if the US lags in research, other countries might get to "dictate how the tech is used". :rage:
