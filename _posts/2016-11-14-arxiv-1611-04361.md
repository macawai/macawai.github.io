abstract: |
  Sequence labeling architectures use word embeddings for capturing similarity,
  but suffer when handling previously unseen or rare words. We investigate
  character-level extensions to such models and propose a novel architecture for
  combining alternative word representations. By using an attention mechanism,
  the model is able to dynamically decide how much information to use from a
  word- or character-level component. We evaluated different architectures on a
  range of sequence labeling datasets, and character-level extensions were found
  to improve performance on every benchmark. In addition, the proposed
  attention-based architecture delivered the best results even with a smaller
  number of trainable parameters.
