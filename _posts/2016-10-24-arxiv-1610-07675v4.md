abstract: |
  We propose a novel method of regularization for recurrent neural networks
  called suprisal-driven zoneout. In this method, states zoneout (maintain their
  previous value rather than updating), when the suprisal (discrepancy between
  the last state's prediction and target) is small. Thus regularization is
  adaptive and input-driven on a per-neuron basis. We demonstrate the
  effectiveness of this idea by achieving state-of-the-art bits per character of
  1.31 on the Hutter Prize Wikipedia dataset, significantly reducing the gap to
  the best known highly-engineered compression methods.
