abstract: |
  We propose a simple but strong baseline for time series classification from
  scratch with deep neural networks. Our proposed baseline models are pure
  end-to-end without any heavy preprocessing on the raw data or feature crafting.
  The FCN achieves premium performance to other state-of-the-art approaches. Our
  exploration of the very deep neural networks with the ResNet structure achieves
  competitive performance under the same simple experiment settings. The simple
  MLP baseline is also comparable to the 1NN-DTW as a previous golden baseline.
  Our models provides a simple choice for the real world application and a good
  starting point for the future research. An overall analysis is provided to
  discuss the generalization of our models, learned features, network structures
  and the classification semantics.
