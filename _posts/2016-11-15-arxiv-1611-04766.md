  We introduce the use of high order automatic differentiation, implemented via
  the algebra of truncated Taylor polynomials, in genetic programming. Using the
  Cartesian Genetic Programming encoding we obtain a high-order Taylor
  representation of the program output that is then used to back-propagate errors
  during learning. The resulting machine learning framework is called
  differentiable Cartesian Genetic Programming (dCGP). In the context of symbolic
  regression, dCGP offers a new approach to the long unsolved problem of constant
  representation in GP expressions. On several problems of increasing complexity
  we find that dCGP is able to find the exact form of the symbolic expression as
  well as the constants values. We also demonstrate the use of dCGP to solve a
  large class of differential equations and to find prime integrals of dynamical
  systems, presenting, in both cases, results that confirm the efficacy of our
  approach.
