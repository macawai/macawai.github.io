  Objective: The advent of High-Performance Computing (HPC) in recent years has
  led to its increasing use in brain study through computational models. The
  scale and complexity of such models are constantly increasing, leading to
  challenging computational requirements. Even though modern HPC platforms can
  often deal with such challenges, the vast diversity of the modeling field does
  not permit for a single acceleration (or homogeneous) platform to effectively
  address the complete array of modeling requirements. Approach: In this paper we
  propose and build BrainFrame, a heterogeneous acceleration platform,
  incorporating three distinct acceleration technologies, a Dataflow Engine, a
  Xeon Phi and a GP-GPU. The PyNN framework is also integrated into the platform.
  As a challenging proof of concept, we analyze the performance of BrainFrame on
  different instances of a state-of-the-art neuron model, modeling the Inferior-
  Olivary Nucleus using a biophysically-meaningful, extended Hodgkin-Huxley
  representation. The model instances take into account not only the neuronal-
  network dimensions but also different network-connectivity circumstances that
  can drastically change application workload characteristics. Main results: The
  synthetic approach of three HPC technologies demonstrated that BrainFrame is
  better able to cope with the modeling diversity encountered. Our performance
  analysis shows clearly that the model directly affect performance and all three
  technologies are required to cope with all the model use cases.
