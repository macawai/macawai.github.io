abstract: |
  In the present work we demonstrate the use of a parcellation free
  connectivity model based on Poisson point processes. This model produces for
  each subject a continuous bivariate intensity function that represents for
  every possible pair of points the relative rate at which we observe tracts
  terminating at those points. We fit this model to explore degree sequence
  equivalents for spatial continuum graphs, and to investigate the local
  differences between estimated intensity functions for two different
  tractography methods. This is a companion paper to Moyer et al. (2016), where
  the model was originally defined.
