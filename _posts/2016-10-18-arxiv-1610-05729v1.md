## Abstract
>   The recently introduced Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites
> (MAP-Elites) is an evolutionary algorithm capable of producing a large archive
> of diverse, high-performing solutions in a single run. It works by discretizing
> a continuous feature space into unique regions according to the desired
> discretization per dimension. While simple, this algorithm has a main drawback:
> it cannot scale to high-dimensional feature spaces since the number of regions
> increase exponentially with the number of dimensions. In this paper, we address
> this limitation by introducing a simple extension of MAP-Elites that has a
> constant, pre-defined number of regions irrespective of the dimensionality of
> the feature space. Our main insight is that methods from computational geometry
> could partition a high-dimensional space into well-spread geometric regions. In
> particular, our algorithm uses a centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) to
> divide the feature space into a desired number of regions; it then places every
> generated individual in its closest region, replacing a less fit one if the
> region is already occupied. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new
> "CVT-MAP-Elites" algorithm in high-dimensional feature spaces through
> comparisons against MAP-Elites in a hexapod locomotion task.
