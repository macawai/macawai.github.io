All your base are belong to DeepMind soon enough. That's right, Blizzard and the team at Google have finally started on the only challenge that matters: finding a way to defeat the [insane APM masters of Starcraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAo3QwnPruc) using the magic of AI. Great redux on the next big "game" challenge for AI, particularly as "a useful bridge to the messiness of the real-world". Get in on the action, and don't forget to check out the post on the [SC2 API](http://us.battle.net/forums/en/sc2/topic/20751114921). And if you're interested in a bit of background, Gamasutra has a great recap on [A Brief History of RTS AI](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/BenWeber/20161106/284970/A_Brief_History_of_RTS_AI_Research.php). [What you say? Make your time. All your base, etc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fvTxv46ano). Viva la Internet. Carry on.
