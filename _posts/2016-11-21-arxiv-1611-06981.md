  Functional connectivity analysis yields powerful insights into our
  understanding of the human brain. Group-wise functional community detection
  aims to partition the brain into clusters, or communities, in which functional
  activity is inter-regionally correlated in a common manner across a group of
  subjects. In this article, we show how to use multiple-view spectral clustering
  to perform group-wise functional community detection. In a series of
  experiments on 291 subjects from the Human Connectome Project, we compare three
  versions of multiple-view spectral clustering: MVSC (uniform weights), MVSCW
  (weights based on subject-specific embedding quality), and AASC (weights
  optimized along with the embedding) with the competing technique of Joint
  Diagonalization of Laplacians (JDL). Results show that multiple-view spectral
  clustering not only yields group-wise functional communities that are more
  consistent than JDL when using randomly selected subsets of individual brains,
  but it is several orders of magnitude faster than JDL.
