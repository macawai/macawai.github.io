abstract: |
  Large-scale integration of emerging nanoscale non-volatile memory devices,
  e.g. resistive random-access memory (RRAM), can enable a new generation of
  neuromorphic computers that can solve a wide range of machine learning
  problems. Such hybrid CMOS-RRAM neuromorphic architectures will result in
  several orders of magnitude reduction in energy consumption at a very small
  form factor, and herald autonomous learning machines capable of self-adapting
  to their environment. However, the progress in this area has been impeded from
  the realization that the actual memory devices fall well short of their
  expected behavior. In this work, we discuss the challenges associated with
  these memory devices and their use in neuromorphic computing circuits, and
  propose pathways to overcome these limitations by introducing 'dendritic
  learning'.
