  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of temporally-coherent blood
  oxygenization level-dependent (BOLD) signal provides an effective means of
  analyzing functionally coherent patterns in the brain. Intrinsic networks and
  functional connectivity are important outcomes of fMRI studies and are central
  to understanding brain function and making diagnoses. The most popular method
  for separating INs, independent component analysis, begins with the assumption
  that the data is a mixture of maximally independent sources. ICA is trainable
  through one of many relatively simple optimization routines that maximize
  non-Gaussianity or minimize mutual information. Although fMRI data is a time
  series, ICA, as with other popular linear methods for separating INs, is
  order-agnostic in time: each multivariate signal at each time step is treated
  as i.i.d.. ICA in its common use in the field employs the same parameterization
  across subjects, which allows for either temporal or spatial variability, but
  not both. In order to overcome shortcomings of temporal ICA in lack of dynamics
  and subject-wise/temporal variability of spatial maps, but without abandoning
  the fundamental strengths of ICA, we combine recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
  with an ICA objective. The resulting model naturally represents temporal and
  spatial dynamics---having subject-wise and temporally variable spatial
  maps---and is easily trainable using gradient descent and back-propagation.
