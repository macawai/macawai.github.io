abstract: |
  Neurodegeneration affects cortical gray matter leading to loss of cortical
  mantle volume. As a result of such volume loss, the geometrical arrangement of
  the regions on the cortical surface is expected to be altered in comparison to
  healthy brains. Here we present a novel method to study the alterations in
  brain cortical surface geometry in Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects with a
  \emph{Geometry Networks (GN)} framework. The local geometrical arrangement of
  the cortical surface is captured as the 3D coordinates of the centroids of
  anatomically defined parcels on the surface. The inter-regional distance
  between cortical patches is the signal of interest and is captured as a
  geometry network. We study its topology by computing the dimensionality of
  simplicial complexes induced on a filtration of binary undirected networks for
  each geometry network. In a permutation statistics test, a statistically
  significant ($p<0.05$) difference was observed in the homology features between
  PD and healthy control groups highlighting its potential to differentiate
  between the groups and their potential utility in disease diagnosis.
