  Neurons, modeled as linear threshold unit (LTU), can in theory compute all
  thresh- old functions. In practice, however, some of these functions require
  synaptic weights of arbitrary large precision. We show here that dendrites can
  alleviate this requirement. We introduce here the non-Linear Threshold Unit
  (nLTU) that integrates synaptic input sub-linearly within distinct subunits to
  take into account local saturation in dendrites. We systematically search
  parameter space of the nTLU and TLU to compare them. Firstly, this shows that
  the nLTU can compute all threshold functions with smaller precision weights
  than the LTU. Secondly, we show that a nLTU can compute significantly more
  functions than a LTU when an input can only make a single synapse. This work
  paves the way for a new generation of network made of nLTU with binary
  synapses.
