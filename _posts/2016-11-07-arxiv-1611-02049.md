  Using WiFi signals for indoor localization is the main localization modality
  of the existing personal indoor localization systems operating on mobile
  devices. WiFi fingerprinting is also used for mobile robots, as WiFi signals
  are usually available indoors and can provide rough initial position estimate
  or can be used together with other positioning systems. Currently, the best
  solutions rely on filtering, manual data analysis, and time-consuming parameter
  tuning to achieve reliable and accurate localization. In this work, we propose
  to use deep neural networks to significantly lower the work-force burden of the
  localization system design, while still achieving satisfactory results.
  Assuming the state-of-the-art hierarchical approach, we employ the DNN system
  for building/floor classification. We show that stacked autoencoders allow to
  efficiently reduce the feature space in order to achieve robust and precise
  classification. The proposed architecture is verified on the publicly available
  UJIIndoorLoc dataset and the results are compared with other solutions.
