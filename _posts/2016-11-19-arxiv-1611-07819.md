abstract: |
  The paper presents a parallel math library, dMath, that demonstrates leading
  scaling when using intranode, internode, and hybrid-parallelism for deep
  learning (DL). dMath provides easy-to-use distributed primitives and a variety
  of domain-specific algorithms including matrix multiplication, convolutions,
  and others allowing for rapid development of scalable applications like deep
  neural networks (DNNs). Persistent data stored in GPU memory and advanced
  memory management techniques avoid costly transfers between host and device.
  dMath delivers performance, portability, and productivity to its specific
  domain of support.
