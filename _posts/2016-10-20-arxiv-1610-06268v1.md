abstract: |
  Reservoir Computing is a bio-inspired computing paradigm for processing time
  dependent signals. The performance of its analogue implementation are
  comparable to other state of the art algorithms for tasks such as speech
  recognition or chaotic time series prediction, but these are often constrained
  by the offline training methods commonly employed. Here we investigated the
  online learning approach by training an opto-electronic reservoir computer
  using a simple gradient descent algorithm, programmed on an FPGA chip. Our
  system was applied to wireless communications, a quickly growing domain with an
  increasing demand for fast analogue devices to equalise the nonlinear distorted
  channels. We report error rates up to two orders of magnitude lower than
  previous implementations on this task. We show that our system is particularly
  well-suited for realistic channel equalisation by testing it on a drifting and
  a switching channels and obtaining good performances
