abstract: |
  We design a non-convex second-order optimization algorithm that is guaranteed
  to return an approximate local minimum in time which is linear in the input
  representation. The time complexity of our algorithm to find an approximate
  local minimum is even faster than that of gradient descent to find a critical
  point. Our algorithm applies to a general class of optimization problems
  including training a neural network and other non-convex objectives arising in
  machine learning.
