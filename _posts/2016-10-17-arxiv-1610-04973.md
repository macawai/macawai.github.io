## Abstract
>   Fuzzy logic is a powerful tool to model knowledge uncertainty, measurements
> imprecision, and vagueness. However, there is another type of vagueness that
> arises when data have multiple forms of expression that fuzzy logic does not
> address quite well. This is the case for multiple instance learning problems
> (MIL). In MIL, an object is represented by a collection of instances, called a
> bag. A bag is labeled negative if all of its instances are negative, and
> positive if at least one of its instances is positive. Positive bags encode
> ambiguity since the instances themselves are not labeled. In this paper, we
> introduce fuzzy inference systems and neural networks designed to handle bags
> of instances as input and capable of learning from ambiguously labeled data.
> First, we introduce the Multiple Instance Sugeno style fuzzy inference
> (MI-Sugeno) that extends the standard Sugeno style inference to handle
> reasoning with multiple instances. Second, we use MI-Sugeno to define and
> develop Multiple Instance Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (MI-ANFIS). We
> expand the architecture of the standard ANFIS to allow reasoning with bags and
> derive a learning algorithm using backpropagation to identify the premise and
> consequent parameters of the network. The proposed inference system is tested
> and validated using synthetic and benchmark datasets suitable for MIL problems.
> We also apply the proposed MI-ANFIS to fuse the output of multiple
> discrimination algorithms for the purpose of landmine detection using Ground
> Penetrating Radar.
