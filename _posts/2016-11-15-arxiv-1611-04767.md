abstract: |
  In this work two soft computing methods, Artificial Neural Networks and
  Genetic Programming, are proposed in order to forecast the mean temperature
  that will occur in future seasons. The area in which the soft computing
  techniques were applied is that of the surroundings of the town of Benevento,
  in the south of Italy, having geographic coordinates (lat. 41{\deg}07'50"N;
  long.14{\deg}47'13"E). This area is not affected by maritime influences as well
  as by winds coming from the west. The methods are fed by data recorded in the
  meteorological stations of Benevento and Castelvenere, located in the hilly
  area, which characterizes the territory surrounding this city, at 144 m a.s.l.
  Both the applied methods show low error rates, while the Genetic Programming
  offers an explicit rule representation (a formula) explaining the prevision.
  Keywords Seasonal Temperature Forecasting; Soft Computing; Artificial Neural
