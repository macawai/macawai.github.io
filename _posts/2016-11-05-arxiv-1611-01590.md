  The storage and computation requirements of Convolutional Neural Networks
  (CNNs) can be prohibitive for exploiting these models over low-power or
  embedded devices. This paper reduces the computational complexity of the CNNs
  by minimizing an objective function, including the recognition loss that is
  augmented with a sparsity-promoting penalty term. The sparsity structure of the
  network is identified using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
  (ADMM), which is widely used in large optimization problems. This method
  alternates between promoting the sparsity of the network and optimizing the
  recognition performance, which allows us to exploit the two-part structure of
  the corresponding objective functions. In particular, we take advantage of the
  separability of the sparsity-inducing penalty functions to decompose the
  minimization problem into sub-problems that can be solved sequentially.
  Applying our method to a variety of state-of-the-art CNN models, our proposed
  method is able to simplify the original model, generating models with less
  computation and fewer parameters, while maintaining and often improving
  generalization performance. Accomplishments on a variety of models strongly
  verify that our proposed ADMM-based method can be a very useful tool for
  simplifying and improving deep CNNs.
