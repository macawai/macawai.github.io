  We propose a new method for learning a representation of image motion in an
  unsupervised fashion. We do so by learning an image sequence embedding that
  respects associativity and invertibility properties of composed sequences with
  known temporal order. This procedure makes minimal assumptions about scene
  content, and the resulting networks learn to exploit rigid and non-rigid motion
  cues. We show that a deep neural network trained to respect these constraints
  implicitly identifies the characteristic motion patterns of many different
  sequence types.
  Our network architecture consists of a CNN followed by an LSTM and is
  structured to learn motion representations over sequences of arbitrary length.
  We demonstrate that a network trained using our unsupervised procedure on
  real-world sequences of human actions and vehicle motion can capture semantic
  regions corresponding to the motion in the scene, and not merely image-level
  differences, without requiring any motion labels. Furthermore, we present
  results that suggest our method can be used to extract information useful for
  independent motion tracking, localization, and nearest neighbor identification.
  Our results suggest that this representation may be useful for motion-related
  tasks where explicit labels are often very difficult to obtain.
