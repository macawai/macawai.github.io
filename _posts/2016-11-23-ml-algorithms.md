A brilliant starting point for clean Python implementations of various types of machine learning algorithms, using numpy, scipy and autograd. Targeted at people who want to learn internals of ml algorithms or implement them from scratch. Includes implementations for various Deep Learning networks (MLP, CNN, RNN, LSTM), Linear regression, Random Forests and several other algorithms. Great learning resource.
