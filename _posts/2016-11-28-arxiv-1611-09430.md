  We describe a neural attention model with a learnable retinal sampling
  lattice. The model is trained on a visual search task requiring the
  classification of an object embedded in a visual scene amidst background
  distractors using the smallest number of fixations. We explore the tiling
  properties that emerge in the model's retinal sampling lattice after training.
  Specifically, we show that this lattice resembles the eccentricity dependent
  sampling lattice of the primate retina, with a high resolution region in the
  fovea surrounded by a low resolution periphery. Furthermore, we find conditions
  where these emergent properties are amplified or eliminated providing clues to
  their function.
