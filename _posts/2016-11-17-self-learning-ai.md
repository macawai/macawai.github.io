A new machine learning training method that enables neural networks to learn directly from human-defined rules (rather than an existing set of examples) appears to outperform more conventional training methods by 160%. "But more surprisingly, their algorithm also outperformed its own training by nine per cent". This approach could potentially open the door for making correct classifications of previously unknown or unlabeled data. Their original research paper ["Hair Segmentation Using Heuristically-Trained Neural Networks"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7592406/?reload=true) is available via the IEEE.
