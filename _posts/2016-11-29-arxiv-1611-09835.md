  In this paper, an active control policy design for a fractional order (FO)
  financial system is attempted, considering multiple conflicting objectives. An
  active control template as a nonlinear state feedback mechanism is developed
  and the controller gains are chosen within a multi-objective optimization (MOO)
  framework to satisfy the conditions of asymptotic stability, derived
  analytically. The MOO gives a set of solutions on the Pareto optimal front for
  the multiple conflicting objectives that are considered. It is shown that there
  is a trade-off between the multiple design objectives and a better performance
  in one objective can only be obtained at the cost of performance deterioration
  in the other objectives. The multi-objective controller design has been
  compared using three different MOO techniques viz. Non Dominated Sorting
  Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), epsilon variable Multi-Objective Genetic
  Algorithm (ev-MOGA), and Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithm with
  Decomposition (MOEA/D). The robustness of the same control policy designed with
  the nominal system settings have been investigated also for gradual decrease in
  the commensurate and incommensurate fractional orders of the financial system.
