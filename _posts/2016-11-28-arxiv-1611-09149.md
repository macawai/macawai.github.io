  Players of coevolutionary games may update not only their strategies but also
  their networks of interaction. Based on interpreting the payoff of players as
  fitness, dynamic landscape models are proposed. The modeling procedure is
  carried out for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) and Snowdrift (SD) games that both use
  either birth-death (BD) or death-birth (DB) strategy updating. With the main
  focus on using dynamic fitness landscapes as an alternative tool for analyzing
  coevolutionary games, landscape measures such as modality, ruggedness and
  information content are computed and analyzed. In addition, fixation properties
  of the games and quantifiers characterizing the network of interaction are
  calculated numerically. Relations are established between landscape properties
  expressed by landscape measures and quantifiers of coevolutionary game dynamics
  such as fixation probabilities, fixation times and network properties
