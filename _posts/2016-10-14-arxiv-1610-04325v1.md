## Abstract
>   Bilinear models provide rich representations compared to linear models. They
> have been applied in various visual tasks, such as object recognition,
> segmentation, and visual question-answering, to get state-of-the-art
> performances taking advantage of the expanded representations. However,
> bilinear representations tend to be high-dimensional, limiting the
> applicability to computationally complex tasks. We propose low-rank bilinear
> neural networks using Hadamard product (element-wise multiplication), commonly
> implemented in many scientific computing frameworks. We show that our model
> outperforms compact bilinear pooling in visual question-answering tasks, having
> a better parsimonious property.
