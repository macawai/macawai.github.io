  Neural networks are usually over-parameterized with significant redundancy in
  the number of required neurons which results in unnecessary computation and
  memory usage at inference time. One common approach to address this issue is to
  prune these big networks by removing extra neurons and parameters while
  maintaining the accuracy. In this paper, we propose NoiseOut, a fully automated
  pruning algorithm based on the correlation between activations of neurons in
  the hidden layers. We prove that adding additional output neurons with entirely
  random targets results into a higher correlation between neurons which makes
  pruning by NoiseOut even more efficient. Finally, we test our method on various
  networks and datasets. These experiments exhibit high pruning rates while
  maintaining the accuracy of the original network.
