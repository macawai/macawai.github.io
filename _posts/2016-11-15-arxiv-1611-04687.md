  Graphs provide a powerful means for representing complex interactions between
  entities. Recently, deep learning approaches are emerging for representing and
  modeling graph-structured data, although the conventional deep learning methods
  (such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks) have
  mainly focused on grid-structured inputs (image and audio). Leveraged by the
  capability of representation learning, deep learning based techniques are
  reporting promising results for graph applications by detecting structural
  characteristics of graphs in an automated fashion. In this paper, we attempt to
  advance deep learning for graph-structured data by incorporating another
  component, transfer learning. By transferring the intrinsic geometric
  information learned in the source domain, our approach can help us to construct
  a model for a new but related task in the target domain without collecting new
  data and without training a new model from scratch. We thoroughly test our
  approach with large-scale real corpora and confirm the effectiveness of the
  proposed transfer learning framework for deep learning on graphs. According to
  our experiments, transfer learning is most effective when the source and target
  domains bear a high level of structural similarity in their graph
  representations.
