abstract: |
  Determining the optimal size and orientation of small-scale residential based
  PV arrays will become increasingly complex in the future smart grid environment
  with the introduction of smart meters and dynamic tariffs. However consumers
  can leverage the availability of smart meter data to conduct a more detailed
  exploration of PV investment options for their particular circumstances. In
  this paper, an optimization method for PV orientation and sizing is proposed
  whereby maximizing the PV investment value is set as the defining objective.
  Solar insolation and PV array models are described to form the basis of the PV
  array optimization strategy. A constrained particle swarm optimization
  algorithm is selected due to its strong performance in non-linear applications.
  The optimization algorithm is applied to real-world metered data to quantify
  the possible investment value of a PV installation under different energy
  retailers and tariff structures. The arrangement with the highest value is
  determined to enable prospective small-scale PV investors to select the most
  cost-effective system.
