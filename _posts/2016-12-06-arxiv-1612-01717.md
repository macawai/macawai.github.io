  Revealing hidden features in unlabeled data is called unsupervised feature
  learning, which plays an important role in pretraining a deep neural network.
  Here we provide a statistical mechanics analysis of the unsupervised learning
  in a restricted Boltzmann machine with binary synapses. A message passing
  equation to infer the hidden feature is derived, and furthermore, variants of
  this equation are analyzed. A statistical analysis by replica theory describes
  the thermodynamic properties of the model. Our analysis confirms an entropy
  crisis preceding the non-convergence of the message passing equation,
  suggesting a discontinuous phase transition as a key characteristic of the
  restricted Boltzmann machine. Continuous phase transition is also confirmed
  depending on the embedded feature strength in the data. The mean-field result
  under the replica symmetric assumption agrees with that obtained by running
  message passing algorithms on single instances of finite sizes. Interestingly,
  in an approximate Hopfield model, the entropy crisis is absent, and a
  continuous phase transition is observed instead. We also develop an iterative
  equation to infer the hyper-parameter (temperature) hidden in the data, which
  in physics corresponds to iteratively imposing Nishimori condition. Our study
  provides insights towards understanding the thermodynamic properties of the
  restricted Boltzmann machine learning, and moreover important theoretical basis
  to build simplified deep networks.
