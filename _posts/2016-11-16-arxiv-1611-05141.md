  We describe a method to train spiking deep networks that can be run using
  leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, achieving state-of-the-art results for
  spiking LIF networks on five datasets, including the large ImageNet ILSVRC-2012
  benchmark. Our method for transforming deep artificial neural networks into
  spiking networks is scalable and works with a wide range of neural
  nonlinearities. We achieve these results by softening the neural response
  function, such that its derivative remains bounded, and by training the network
  with noise to provide robustness against the variability introduced by spikes.
  Our analysis shows that implementations of these networks on neuromorphic
  hardware will be many times more power-efficient than the equivalent
  non-spiking networks on traditional hardware.
