  Visual cortex's hierarchical, multi-level organization is captured in many
  biologically inspired computational vision models, the general idea being that
  progressively larger scale, more complex spatiotemporal features are
  represented in progressively higher areas. However, most earlier models use
  localist representations (codes) in each representational field, which we
  equate with the cortical macrocolumn (mac), at each level. In localism, each
  represented feature/event (item) is coded by a single unit. Our model, Sparsey,
  is also hierarchical but crucially, uses sparse distributed coding (SDC) in
  every mac in all levels. In SDC, each represented item is coded by a small
  subset of the mac's units. SDCs of different items can overlap and the size of
  overlap between items can represent their similarity. The difference between
  localism and SDC is crucial because SDC allows the two essential operations of
  associative memory, storing a new item and retrieving the best-matching stored
  item, to be done in fixed time for the life of the model. Since the model's
  core algorithm, which does both storage and retrieval (inference), makes a
  single pass over all macs on each time step, the overall model's
  storage/retrieval operation is also fixed-time, a criterion we consider
  essential for scalability to huge datasets. A 2010 paper described a
  nonhierarchical version of this model in the context of purely spatial pattern
  processing. Here, we elaborate a fully hierarchical model (arbitrary numbers of
  levels and macs per level), describing novel model principles like progressive
  critical periods, dynamic modulation of principal cells' activation functions
  based on a mac-level familiarity measure, representation of multiple
  simultaneously active hypotheses, a novel method of time warp invariant
  recognition, and we report results showing learning/recognition of
  spatiotemporal patterns.
