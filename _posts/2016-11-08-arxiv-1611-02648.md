abstract: |
  We study a variant of the variational autoencoder model with a Gaussian
  mixture as a prior distribution, with the goal of performing unsupervised
  clustering through deep generative models. We observe that the standard
  variational approach in these models is unsuited for unsupervised clustering,
  and mitigate this problem by leveraging a principled information-theoretic
  regularisation term known as consistency violation. Adding this term to the
  standard variational optimisation objective yields networks with both
  meaningful internal representations and well-defined clusters. We demonstrate
  the performance of this scheme on synthetic data, MNIST and SVHN, showing that
  the obtained clusters are distinct, interpretable and result in achieving
  higher performance on unsupervised clustering classification than previous
  approaches.
