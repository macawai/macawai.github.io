  In this paper, we propose a novel approach (SAPEO) to support the survival
  selection process in multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with surrogate
  models - it dynamically chooses individuals to evaluate exactly based on the
  model uncertainty and the distinctness of the population. We introduce variants
  that differ in terms of the risk they allow when doing survival selection.
  Here, the anytime performance of different SAPEO variants is evaluated in
  conjunction with an SMS-EMOA using the BBOB bi-objective benchmark. We compare
  the obtained results with the performance of the regular SMS-EMOA, as well as
  another surrogate-assisted approach. The results open up general questions
  about the applicability and required conditions for surrogate-assisted
  multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to be tackled in the future.
