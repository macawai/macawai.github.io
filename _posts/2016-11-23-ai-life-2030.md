A hundred year study on AI? Yep. [Thanks Stanford AI100!](https://ai100.stanford.edu/). An excellent redux by The Morning Paper of the key findings in this first report. [The full report PDF](https://ai100.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/ai_100_report_0831fnl.pdf) is a (fairly long 48 page) great read.
