abstract: |
  The omnipresence of deep learning architectures such as deep convolutional
  neural networks (CNN)s is fueled by the synergistic combination of
  ever-increasing labeled datasets and specialized hardware. Despite the
  indisputable success, the reliance on huge amounts of labeled data and
  specialized hardware can be a limiting factor when approaching new
  applications. To help alleviating these limitations, we propose an efficient
  learning strategy for layer-wise unsupervised training of deep CNNs on
  conventional hardware in acceptable time. Our proposed strategy consists of
  randomly convexifying the reconstruction contractive auto-encoding (RCAE)
  learning objective and solving the resulting large-scale convex minimization
  problem in the frequency domain via coordinate descent (CD). The main
  advantages of our proposed learning strategy are: (1) single tunable
  optimization parameter; (2) fast and guaranteed convergence; (3) possibilities
  for full parallelization. Numerical experiments show that our proposed learning
  strategy scales (in the worst case) linearly with image size, number of filters
  and filter size.
