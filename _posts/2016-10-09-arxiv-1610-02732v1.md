## Abstract
>   Evolutionary algorithms have been successfully applied to a variety of
> optimisation problems in stationary environments. However, many real world
> optimisation problems are set in dynamic environments where the success
> criteria shifts regularly. Population diversity affects algorithmic
> performance, particularly on multiobjective and dynamic problems. Diversity
> mechanisms are methods of altering evolutionary algorithms in a way that
> promotes the maintenance of population diversity. This project intends to
> measure and compare the performance effect a variety of diversity mechanisms
> have on an evolutionary algorithm when facing an assortment of dynamic
> problems.
