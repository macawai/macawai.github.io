  The applicability of fractional order (FO) automatic generation control (AGC)
  for power system frequency oscillation damping is investigated in this paper,
  employing distributed energy generation. The hybrid power system employs
  various autonomous generation systems like wind turbine, solar photovoltaic,
  diesel engine, fuel-cell and aqua electrolyzer along with other energy storage
  devices like the battery and flywheel. The controller is placed in a remote
  location while receiving and sending signals over an unreliable communication
  network with stochastic delay. The controller parameters are tuned using robust
  optimization techniques employing different variants of Particle Swarm
  Optimization (PSO) and are compared with the corresponding optimal solutions.
  An archival based strategy is used for reducing the number of function
  evaluations for the robust optimization methods. The solutions obtained through
  the robust optimization are able to handle higher variation in the controller
  gains and orders without significant decrease in the system performance. This
  is desirable from the FO controller implementation point of view, as the design
  is able to accommodate variations in the system parameter which may result due
  to the approximation of FO operators, using different realization methods and
  order of accuracy. Also a comparison is made between the FO and the integer
  order (IO) controllers to highlight the merits and demerits of each scheme.
