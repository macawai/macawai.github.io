  By recording multiple cells simultaneously, electrophysiologists have found
  evidence for repeating spatiotemporal spike patterns. In sensory systems in
  particular, repeating a sensory sequence typically elicits a reproducible spike
  pattern, which carries information about the sensory sequence. How this
  information is readout by downstream neurons is unclear. In this theoretical
  paper, we investigate to what extent a single cell could detect a given spike
  pattern and what are the optimal parameters to do so, in particular the
  membrane time constant $\tau$. Using a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron
  with instantaneous synapses and homogeneous Poisson inputs, we computed this
  optimum analytically. Our results indicate that a relatively small $\tau$ (at
  most a few tens of ms) is usually optimal, even when the pattern is longer.
  This is somewhat surprising as the resulting detector ignores most of the
  pattern, due to its fast memory decay. Next, we wondered if
  spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) could enable a neuron to reach the
  theoretical optimum. We simulated a LIF neuron equipped with additive STDP, and
  repeatedly exposed to a given input spike pattern. As in previous studies, the
  LIF progressively became selective to the repeating pattern with no
  supervision, even when the pattern was embedded in Poisson activity. Here we
  show that, using certain STDP parameters, the resulting pattern detector can be
  optimal. Taken together, these results may explain how humans can learn
  repeating visual or auditory sequences. Long sequences could be recognized
  thanks to coincidence detectors working at a much shorter timescale. This is
  consistent with the fact that recognition is still possible if a sound sequence
  is compressed of played backward, or scrambled using 10ms bins. Coincidence
  detection is a simple yet powerful mechanism, which could be the main function
  of neurons in the brain.
