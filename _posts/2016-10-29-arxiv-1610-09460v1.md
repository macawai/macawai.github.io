  Ensuring sustainability demands more efficient energy management with
  minimized energy wastage. Therefore, the power grid of the future should
  provide an unprecedented level of flexibility in energy management. To that
  end, intelligent decision making requires accurate predictions of future energy
  demand/load, both at aggregate and individual site level. Thus, energy load
  forecasting have received increased attention in the recent past, however has
  proven to be a difficult problem. This paper presents a novel energy load
  forecasting methodology based on Deep Neural Networks, specifically Long Short
  Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms. The presented work investigates two variants of
  the LSTM: 1) standard LSTM and 2) LSTM-based Sequence to Sequence (S2S)
  architecture. Both methods were implemented on a benchmark data set of
  electricity consumption data from one residential customer. Both architectures
  where trained and tested on one hour and one-minute time-step resolution
  datasets. Experimental results showed that the standard LSTM failed at
  one-minute resolution data while performing well in one-hour resolution data.
  It was shown that S2S architecture performed well on both datasets. Further, it
  was shown that the presented methods produced comparable results with the other
  deep learning methods for energy forecasting in literature.
