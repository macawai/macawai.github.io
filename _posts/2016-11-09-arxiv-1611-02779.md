  Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has been successful in learning
  sophisticated behaviors automatically; however, the learning process requires a
  huge number of trials. In contrast, animals can learn new tasks in just a few
  trials, benefiting from their prior knowledge about the world. This paper seeks
  to bridge this gap. Rather than designing a "fast" reinforcement learning
  algorithm, we propose to represent it as a recurrent neural network (RNN) and
  learn it from data. In our proposed method, RL$^2$, the algorithm is encoded in
  the weights of the RNN, which are learned slowly through a general-purpose
  ("slow") RL algorithm. The RNN receives all information a typical RL algorithm
  would receive, including observations, actions, rewards, and termination flags;
  and it retains its state across episodes in a given Markov Decision Process
  (MDP). The activations of the RNN store the state of the "fast" RL algorithm on
  the current (previously unseen) MDP. We evaluate RL$^2$ experimentally on both
  small-scale and large-scale problems. On the small-scale side, we train it to
  solve randomly generated multi-arm bandit problems and finite MDPs. After
  RL$^2$ is trained, its performance on new MDPs is close to human-designed
  algorithms with optimality guarantees. On the large-scale side, we test RL$^2$
  on a vision-based navigation task and show that it scales up to
  high-dimensional problems.

  Reinforcement learning for RNNs can be slow. This means many practical cases
  tweak the classical algorithm using domain knowledge to obtain better
  convergence levels and rates. An alternative to such custom learning schemes
  is presented in this paper, where the learning scheme is also learned
  by reinforcement as the algorithm progresses. This is shown to have similar
  convergence properties to custom algorithms in several cases.
