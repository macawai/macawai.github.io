abstract: |
  In oncology, Positron Emission Tomography imaging is widely used in
  diagnostics of cancer metastases, in monitoring of progress in course of the
  cancer treatment, and in planning radiotherapeutic interventions. Accurate and
  reproducible delineation of the tumor in the Positron Emission Tomography scans
  remains a difficult task, despite being crucial for delivering appropriate
  radiation dose, minimizing adverse side-effects of the therapy, and reliable
  evaluation of treatment. In this piece of research we attempt to solve the
  problem of automated delineation of the tumor using 3d implementations of the
  spatial distance weighted fuzzy c-means, the deep convolutional neural network
  and a dictionary model. The methods, in diverse ways, combine intensity and
  spatial information.
