  The use of unsupervised data in addition to supervised data in training
  discriminative neural networks has improved the performance of this clas-
  sification scheme. However, the best results were achieved with a training
  process that is divided in two parts: first an unsupervised pre-training step
  is done for initializing the weights of the network and after these weights are
  refined with the use of supervised data. On the other hand adversarial noise
  has improved the results of clas- sical supervised learning. Recently, a new
  neural network topology called Ladder Network, where the key idea is based in
  some properties of hierar- chichal latent variable models, has been proposed as
  a technique to train a neural network using supervised and unsupervised data at
  the same time with what is called semi-supervised learning. This technique has
  reached state of the art classification. In this work we add adversarial noise
  to the ladder network and get state of the art classification, with several
  important conclusions on how adversarial noise can help in addition with new
  possible lines of investi- gation. We also propose an alternative to add
  adversarial noise to unsu- pervised data.
