  We present a confidence-based single-layer feed-forward learning algorithm
  SPIRAL (Spike Regularized Adaptive Learning) relying on an encoding of
  activation spikes. We adaptively update a weight vector relying on confidence
  estimates and activation offsets relative to previous activity. We regularize
  updates proportionally to item-level confidence and weight-specific support,
  loosely inspired by the observation from neurophysiology that high spike rates
  are sometimes accompanied by low temporal precision. Our experiments suggest
  that the new learning algorithm SPIRAL is more robust and less prone to
  overfitting than both the averaged perceptron and AROW.
