From self-proclaimed "white boy, straight outta Cambridge, UK" comes a fun ML driven rapbot. Talks through some of the techniques used ([beam search](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D13-1022)) as well as challenges and failures of the model (ABAB type rhyming). It also touches on the consequences of your training data having biases that may not be politically correct or socially acceptable. Discovering that your ML model is a hardcore misogynist can be a shock, and the author notes that "machine learning algorithms like this rarely act how you want them to without some supervision". Also references the excellent [RNN post from Andrej Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/), which is definitely worth a read.
