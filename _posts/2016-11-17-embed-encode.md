"Over the last six months, a powerful new neural network playbook has come together for Natural Language Processing. The new approach can be summarised as a simple four-step formula: embed, encode, attend, predict"

"Most NLP problems can be reduced to machine learning problems that take one or more texts as input. If we can transform these texts to vectors, we can reuse general purpose deep learning solutions." - this blog post walks through the how-to.
