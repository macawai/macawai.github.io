  In this paper, we tackle a problem of predicting phenotypes from structural
  connectomes. We propose that normalized Laplacian spectra can capture
  structural properties of brain networks, and hence graph spectral distributions
  are useful for a task of connectome-based classification. We introduce a kernel
  that is based on earth mover's distance (EMD) between spectral distributions of
  brain networks. We access performance of an SVM classifier with the proposed
  kernel for a task of classification of autism spectrum disorder versus typical
  development based on a publicly available dataset. Classification quality (area
  under the ROC-curve) obtained with the EMD-based kernel on spectral
  distributions is 0.71, which is higher than that based on simpler graph
  embedding methods.
