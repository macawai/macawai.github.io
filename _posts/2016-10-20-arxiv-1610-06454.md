  Hypothesis testing is an important cognitive process that supports human
  reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a computational hypothesis testing
  approach based on memory augmented neural networks. Our approach involves a
  hypothesis testing loop that reconsiders and progressively refines a previously
  formed hypothesis in order to generate new hypotheses to test. We apply the
  proposed approach to language comprehension task by using Neural Semantic
  Encoders (NSE). Our NSE models achieve the state-of-the-art results showing an
  absolute improvement of 1.2% to 2.6% accuracy over previous results obtained by
  single and ensemble systems on standard machine comprehension benchmarks such
  as the Children's Book Test (CBT) and Who-Did-What (WDW) news article datasets.
