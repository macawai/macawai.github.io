A short video (9 min) of Obama talking with Wired about AI and its impacts on economic and social models, particularly how we mitigate the potentially destabilising effects of an AI-first world (in particular, employment, wage-suppression and inequality). See the related Whitehouse paper on ["Preparing for the Future of AI"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/whitehouse_files/microsites/ostp/NSTC/preparing_for_the_future_of_ai.pdf)
