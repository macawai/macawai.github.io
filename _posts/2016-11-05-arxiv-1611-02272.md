  We report first observations of an integrated analog photonic network, in
  which connections are configured by microring weight banks, as well as the
  first use of electro-optic modulators as photonic neurons. A mathematical
  isomorphism between the silicon photonic circuit and a continuous neural model
  is demonstrated through dynamical bifurcation analysis. Exploiting this
  isomorphism, existing neural engineering tools can be adapted to silicon
  photonic information processing systems. A 49-node silicon photonic neural
  network programmed using a "neural compiler" is simulated and predicted to
  outperform a conventional approach 1,960-fold in a toy differential system
  emulation task. Photonic neural networks leveraging silicon photonic platforms
  could access new regimes of ultrafast information processing for radio,
  control, and scientific computing.
