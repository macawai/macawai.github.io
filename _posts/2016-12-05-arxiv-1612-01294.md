  Communicating and sharing intelligence among agents is an important facet of
  achieving Artificial General Intelligence. As a first step towards this
  challenge, we introduce a novel framework for image generation: Message Passing
  Multi-Agent Generative Adversarial Networks (MPM GANs). While GANs have
  recently been shown to be very effective for image generation and other tasks,
  these networks have been limited to mostly single generator-discriminator
  networks. We show that we can obtain multi-agent GANs that communicate through
  message passing to achieve better image generation. The objectives of the
  individual agents in this framework are two fold: a co-operation objective and
  a competing objective. The co-operation objective ensures that the message
  sharing mechanism guides the other generator to generate better than itself
  while the competing objective encourages each generator to generate better than
  its counterpart. We analyze and visualize the messages that these GANs share
  among themselves in various scenarios. We quantitatively show that the message
  sharing formulation serves as a regularizer for the adversarial training.
  Qualitatively, we show that the different generators capture different traits
  of the underlying data distribution.
