abstract: |
  Understanding brain connectivity in a network-theoretic context has shown
  much promise in recent years. This type of analysis identifies brain
  organisational principles, bringing a new perspective to neuroscience. At the
  same time, large public databases of connectomic data are now available.
  However, connectome analysis is still an emerging field and there is a crucial
  need for robust computational methods to fully unravelits potential. This
  workshop provides a platform to discuss the development of new analytic
  techniques; methods for evaluating and validating commonly used approaches; as
  well as the effects of variations in pre-processing steps.
