  Recently published methods enable training of bitwise neural networks which
  allow reduced representation of down to a single bit per weight. We present a
  method that exploits ensemble decisions based on multiple stochastically
  sampled network models to increase performance figures of bitwise neural
  networks in terms of classification accuracy at inference. Our experiments with
  the CIFAR-10 and GTSRB datasets show that the performance of such network
  ensembles surpasses the performance of the high-precision base model. With this
  technique we achieve 5.81% best classification error on CIFAR-10 test set using
  bitwise networks. Concerning inference on embedded systems we evaluate these
  bitwise networks using a hardware efficient stochastic rounding procedure. Our
  work contributes to efficient embedded bitwise neural networks.
