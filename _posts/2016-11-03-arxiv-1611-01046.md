  Many inference problems involve data generation processes that are not
  uniquely specified or are uncertain in some way. In a scientific context, the
  presence of several plausible data generation processes is often associated to
  the presence of systematic uncertainties. Robust inference is possible if it is
  based on a pivot -- a quantity whose distribution is invariant to the unknown
  value of the (categorical or continuous) nuisance parameters that parametrizes
  this family of generation processes. In this work, we introduce a flexible
  training procedure based on adversarial networks for enforcing the pivotal
  property on a predictive model. We derive theoretical results showing that the
  proposed algorithm tends towards a minimax solution corresponding to a
  predictive model that is both optimal and independent of the nuisance
  parameters (if that models exists) or for which one can tune the trade-off
  between power and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this
  approach with a toy example and an example from particle physics.
