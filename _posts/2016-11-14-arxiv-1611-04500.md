  We study a simple notion of structural invariance that readily suggests a
  parameter-sharing scheme in deep neural networks. In particular, we define
  structure as a collection of relations, and derive graph convolution and
  recurrent neural networks as special cases. We study composition of basic
  structures in defining models that are invariant to more complex "product"
  structures such as graph of graphs, sets of images or sequence of sets. For
  demonstration, our experimental results are focused on the setting where the
  discrete structure of interest is a set. We present results on several novel
  and non-trivial problems on sets, including semi-supervised learning using
  clustering information, point-cloud classification and set outlier detection.
