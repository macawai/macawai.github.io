abstract: |
  An architecture of a new neuro-fuzzy system is proposed. The basic idea of
  this approach is to tune both synaptic weights and membership functions with
  the help of the supervised learning and self-learning paradigms. The approach
  to solving the problem has to do with evolving online neuro-fuzzy systems that
  can process data under uncertainty conditions. The results prove the
  effectiveness of the developed architecture and the learning procedure.
